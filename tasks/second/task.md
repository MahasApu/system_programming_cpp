# The 2nd NSTT:

Prepare a small framework to work with `lines on a plane`.

- Define a struct/class for `Point` and `Line`.
- Add constructors from 2 points and from
coefficients.
- Add functions to find intersection with other line, finding a perpendicular line at some point.

Your solution should avoid copying structures and try
be as safe as possible (via const). Donâ€™t forget
about tests and sanitizers.
