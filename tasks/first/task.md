# The 1st NSTT:

Choose one of these well known data
structures: `AVL-tree`, `Treap` or `Fibonacci Heap`.

Implement it on C++ and design a class that
represents the data structure.

Add `constructors`, `destructors`, `public` and
`private` fields to keep needed invariants.

Prepare tests and check your code with
sanitizers.



# The 3rd NSTT:

Improve solution from NSTT #1 by adding
`copy constructors` and `copy assignment operators`
where needed.

Also, use `member initializers lists` in constructors.

Don’t forget to add tests that show that copy
constructors and assign operators work correctly.



# The 4th NSTT:

Improve solution from NSTT #1 by adding
`move constructors` and `move assignment operators`
where needed.

Don’t forget to add tests that show that copy
constructors and assign operators work correctly.
